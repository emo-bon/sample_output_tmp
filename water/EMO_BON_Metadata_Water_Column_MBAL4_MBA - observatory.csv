The long-term ecological site has been studied for over a century, with plankton sampled from viruses, bacteria and fungi to large zooplankton and fish larvae. The site is also utilised for adult fish surveys and eDNA-based assessments of marine biodiversity. Station L4 is typically seasonally stratified and sometimes impacted by estuarine waters from the adjacent rivers Tamar and Plym. In a typical year, a spring diatom bloom is followed by Phaeocystis and other major phytoplankton groups including dinoflagellates. The site has been subjected to a broad range of omics and molecular-based studies, including metabarcoding, metagenomics and single-cell approaches.",Michael Cunliffe,micnli@mba.ac.uk,0000-0002-6716-3555,PRJEB51688,PRJEB51657
