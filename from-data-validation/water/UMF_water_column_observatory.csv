Benthic soft bottom fauna is also monitored in the area for the Swedish national monitoring program. A buoy is located near this station that records weather and water parameters every hour when it is deployed. The spring bloom occurs from April to May every year and there can often be a diatom bloom in September or October. Cyanobacteria blooms commonly occur here in late summer and autumn. Genomic samples have previously been taken at this station by a professor at Umeå University for a year.",Annie Marie Cox,annie.cox@umu.se,,PRJEB51688,PRJEB57914
