Hydrological parameters area acquired automatically every 10’ at three levels. We sampled the site for OSD events for 2014 2015 and 2016 years. We monitor harmul species (HAB) and for the area DSP events are quite common due to the presence of Diophysis spp. We usually observe late winter and spring blooms.","Mauro Bastianini","mauro.bastianini@ismar.cnr.it","0000-0001-6758-4192","PRJEB51688","PRJEB50566"
